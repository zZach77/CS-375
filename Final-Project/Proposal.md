For this project, I plan on making a music visualizer using three.js. The basic idea is to select a song to be played, and have graphics that
move/change according to the beat/rythm of the song. 

Week 1 - Plan the visualization design and audio analysis strategy

  Choose a graphics and audio library to use for the project
  Research different audio analysis techniques, such as Fourier transform, beat detection, or envelope following
  Create a simple prototype that displays the audio waveform and a static visual effect
  
Week 2 - Implement the basic visualization features like waveform and spectrogram

  Implement the audio analysis techniques to extract frequency bands and other features
  Display the frequency bands as a spectrogram or a bar graph in real-time
  Map the frequency bands to visual effects, such as particle systems or geometric shapes
  
Week 3 - Add more advanced features like particle systems and dynamic effects

  Implement more complex visual effects that respond to the audio input, such as particle systems that move and emit light in response to the beat
  Add user preferences to customize the visual effects, such as color, size, and motion parameters
  Add a user interface to control the audio playback and the visualizer settings

Week 4 - Add user preferences, audio input control, and polish the visualization for final presentation

  Add more user preferences, such as the ability to adjust the sensitivity of the visualizer to different frequency bands or the overall volume of 
  the audio
  Add support for different audio sources, such as microphone input or streaming audio
  Polish the visualization and the user interface for the final presentation, and document the project
