Final project for CS 375 - Computer Graphics
Author: Zach Gassner
Project: Music Visualizer

To run this project, delete 'package-lock.json' and the 'node-modules' directory. 
Then type 'npm install', then type 'npx vite' and open up the localhost link that pops up.
From there there should be a green play button, just hit that and the audio show start
playing along with the rendered scene.
