# Assignment 1

The website I checked out was [WebGL Samples](https://webglsamples.org). I thought it was a cool website. 
There were different WebGL projects that you could click on to check out. Some of the projects had an
interactive part where you could change certain things. For example, there was one that was an aquarium with
fish swimming around your point of view, and you could change how many fish were swimming around. There was
another one that was like a short trailer for an animated movie and you could change the colors such as
saturated, posterize, color negative, nightvision, thermal, and infared to name a few.
